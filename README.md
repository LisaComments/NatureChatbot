# AI Answer Engine with Next.js and TypeScript

This project is focused on building an **AI Answer Engine** inspired by Perplexity.ai, utilizing **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and advanced web scraping techniques. The engine mitigates hallucinations by citing sources for all provided answers. You will be creating an interface similar to [WebChat.so](https://www.webchat.so/).

## Features
- **Scrape Website Content**: Parse and extract content from URLs provided by the user.
- **Source-Cited Responses**: Deliver AI-powered answers with accurate source citations.
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Allow users to ask questions, paste URLs, and share/continue conversations.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate-limiting functionality to manage usage.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: Framework for the web application.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for improved developer experience.
- **Groq**: Query language for structured data.
- **Cheerio and Puppeteer**: Libraries for web scraping.
- **Redis**: Used for rate-limiting middleware.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Backend support for natural language understanding.
